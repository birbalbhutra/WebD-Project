PROJECT :-

The objective of the project is to develop a client interface and 
an API backend for invoicing management


IMPLEMENTATION:-

The project has been implemented with the help of 

FRONTEND -  HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT has been used for developing all the
            responsive webpages.

BACKEND  -  NodeJS has been used for developing the API of invoicing
            management.


EXPERIENCE:-

The overall learning and developing of the project has given a very good
exposure on how to create a fullstack website, since we have implemented
both frontend and backend. I have learned a lot of new things which were 
otherwise won't we so easy to learn and use.


CHALLENGES FACED:-

The most challenging aspect of the project was to create dyanmic and responsive 
webpages. We were required to create static templates which were then filled
dynamically with the help of our scripting language and backend API. The webpage 
also needed to be secure, so login feature was also required such that only verified
users can access the website (Done with the help of json webtoken). 


Overall the whole process was very amazing and exciting.
